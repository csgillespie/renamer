Description: This package does four things. First, it changes camelCase to under_score_case 
  and vice-versa. Secondly, it fills in the three hour Newcastle-London
  train journey. Third, it improves my knowledge of manipulating functions. Fourth,
  it provides an excellent April Fools joke.
Depends: R (>= 3.1.3)
